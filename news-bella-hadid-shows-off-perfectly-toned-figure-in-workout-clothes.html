"I order a lot of green juices and keep them around on set. I have ginger shots in a cooler, and I'll drink one if I'm feeling low," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harper's Bazaar</span></a><span>. "I'm also a big coffee drinker. I'll have three espressos before noon."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/shutterstock_1219291654.jpg><p><span>Bella knows the importance of fueling up in the morning. "If I have the morning off, I'll either make eggs and sausage, and eat breakfast at home, or go to the bagel store below my apartment. … My go-to is an egg sandwich on a plain bagel," she told Harper's.</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/GettyImages-1328187450.jpg><p><span>Because Bella has "really low blood sugar" she has to "eat all the time" to maintain energy. "I like having a good protein meal because I get really tired if I eat too much, so I try to fill myself up with things that will make me feel good," she told Harper's Bazaar. She also makes sure to eat something prior to a workout session. "I count on a smoothie, a juice or a protein drink 30 minutes before the session," she added to Vogue Paris. "After the session I eat something full of protein like chicken and wholegrain rice. It's ideal to strengthen the muscle mass and to increase the effects of the session."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/GettyImages-1328036010.jpg><p><span>When Bella works out, she doesn't mess around, revealing to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>E! News</span></a><span> that they often last up to a whopping two hours. "I train and I work out hard for two hours — I don't like to do the whole yoga thing. I think yoga is calming, it's amazing, but if I'm going to go for it, I'm going to go hard," she said. "Put in 100% from the start to the end of a workout. There is nothing better than to push yourself to the limit, while making the most of it. Going to the gym for two hours with only 50% motivation is the best way of erasing the feeling of accomplishment and well-being that boosts self-confidence that you get from a workout," she added to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Vogue France</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Bella trains at The Dogpound, a New York and Los Angeles based gym focusing on hardcore, HIIT workouts. She also trains at Gotham gym in New York City.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/GettyImages-1327313340.jpg><p><span>Bella also relies on boxing to stay in fighting form. "I train with my coach for intensive sessions. I run non-stop for 20 minutes followed by a boxing session and finally a series of weights targeting the abs and glutes," she told Vogue France.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkm52coa5utMCdoJ1lo528uL%2BMqJ2fZaCav6exwq2jsmWkpLumsIyfoKCtopp6qrqMsKaro5%2BqwW6vy6iroZ2jZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-lowell-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Lowell Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</span></a>
