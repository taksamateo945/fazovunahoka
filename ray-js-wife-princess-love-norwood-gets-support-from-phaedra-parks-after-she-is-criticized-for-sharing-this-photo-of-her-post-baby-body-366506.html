You can’t have a childlike three days ago and so obsessed over a body. 🙄🙄🙄🙄 I guess it’s a Hollyweird thing.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7uoHk4gvQD/</p><p>Princess Love hit back with: “Shut up.”</p><p>A defender stated: “You do you… Your body looks great… I have had ten children, and I am trying to get back before any kids… Work in progress 💖💖💖.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7TgNu0glSS/</p><p>The critic came back to explain herself: “No one said she doesn’t look good; even a blind person can see that she’s beautiful. But it’s not normal how the pressure in Hollyweird makes women focus only on snapping back. Look at Draya after having given birth. She was in the gym after one day. Well, maybe to Americans it’s normal.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7wMxjtg_ht/</p><p>This backer replied: “Right!! You have to be sure you are good… you are def focusing on tour kiddos and taking care of you… why do people come on your page and talk Chit????”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7_qeQDAiVf/</p><p>The same critic continued: “Never said you said she doesn’t look good. Re-read my statement. My point was damn, can’t she look good for herself? Not everyone is doing things for other people or pleasing everyone, it’s not good to make assumptions. 🤷🏿‍♀️ Hater? You guys are Haters. I didn’t say anything, viciously. But women in Hollywood focus on snapping back ASAP. It’s pressure. Is she’s not pressured it’s okay? I can see that the princess is a gorgeous woman who does not have to feel insecure. As I already said, it’s an American thing. No hate here just concerned.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B7HgDu4AGcg/</p><p>A fan hit back with: “You are saying she doesn’t focus on her kids, and those are fighting words. Your pretty much saying she’s more worried about herself than her child’s needs, which is not for you to say & it’s rude as hell. She’s glowing & bouncing back, no need for the negativity or jealousy. Just plain rude.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Princess Love is a very compelling character.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeilsZuttJmrqKelWK9s7XNnJysq12hvLexjKemq6%2BfpLFus8StqmarpaW9sL7TZp2rp51ivamtxJ2pmmWglr%2Bsv4yana2domLAqbGMoqpmm6KewaqvyLOcnWWWpL9uv8eaqaKml2LBqbXSZqehp6SkerCyjKGcq2WgpMC1ecGambJlkqSxunmSb21uaGZk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-golic-jr.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Golic Jr : Broadcaster, Football, Wife, Net Worth !</span></a>
