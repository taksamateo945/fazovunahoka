This Monday night, around the same time as the protests in West Hollywood, Gore posted a picture of himself with what appeared to look like a large gun.</p><p>Gore wrote in the caption that Sunset Boulevard was being looted and that if anyone tried to do the same thing to his property, he was going to light them up. Before he worked on the SVU spin-off, he also worked on NBC’s Chicago PD.</p><p>In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, Wolf wrote that he wouldn’t tolerate such conduct, especially during such a turbulent time. In case you missed it, NBC picked up on another SVU spin-off back in March of this year.</p><p>It revolves around the character portrayed by the beloved Christopher Meloni, Detective Stabler. In addition to the firing of the actor at the demand of Wolf, Meloni also commented on the incident. You can see what he had to say in the tweet below:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Truth:</p><p>Matt Olmstead is my Showrunner</p><p>I have gotten no word on ANY hirings</p><p>I have no idea who this person is or what they do <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/Mtik40kij7</a></p><p>— Chris Meloni (@Chris_Meloni) <a href=# rel=nofollow>June 2, 2020</a></p><p>Of course, Gore was referring to the nationwide protests and demonstrations in the United States at the moment which spread to other areas of the world, including Canada and the United Kingdom.</p><p>While it initially started out as a peaceful demonstration, it quickly turned into riots, vandalism, and looting. However, the delinquents didn’t deface every piece of property.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Vanessa Bryant, the widowed wife of Kobe Bryant, took to her Instagram Stories this Monday to share a picture of an untouched mural of Kobe and Gianna in LA. Vanessa shared her love for the city of Los Angeles by expressing a heart emoji alongside the caption that read, “Kobe and Gianna.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUnrCsedaoo59llqe8rnnLmq5mmZ6ZerC%2Bw56pZqumqnqntdGeqmavop7Bpr6MsJ%2BoZaOWxrR5x55ksKelobFuuMign61lpaV6sb7OrZysrJ%2BnwG61xWaroZ2pYsOiusOao6KylZl6qbXSZqerp6Cav7XFjG1na3BnbXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1554991-ranking-each-decade-of-nba-basketball-from-the-1960s-to-today.html><span>←</span><span>Ranking Each Decade of NBA Basketball, from the 1960s to Today | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, an</span></a>
