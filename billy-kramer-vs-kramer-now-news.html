Their young co-star—who still the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>holds a Guinness World Record</a> for the youngest person ever nominated for a competitive acting Oscar—would go on to star in another iconic, genre-defining film before finding a quieter life offscreen.

At age 13, Henry played Ringwald's character's annoying little brother Mike in the beloved teen comedy.</p><p>He also appeared in several lesser-known films throughout the 1980s, including Martin's Day with <strong>Richard Harris </strong>and Sweet Hearts Dance with <strong>Susan Sarandon</strong>. He later acted in the 1996 made-for-TV movie Andersonville and appeared in two episodes of ER. Since 2000, Henry has acted occasionally in direct-to-video films and guest-starred on My Own Worst Enemy and Brothers and Sisters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Justin-Henry-in-1985.jpg><p>After appearing in four films between 1983 and 1985, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Henry took a break from acting</a> to go to elementary school like a normal kid, the actor told the On Screen & Beyond podcast in 2014. He said he also "took a sabbatical" from acting when it came time for college. Henry attended Skidmore College in New York, where he eschewed acting classes to study psychology and art history, according to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>his LinkedIn page</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Justin-Henry-in-2005.jpg><p>In 1998, Henry co-founded the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Slamdunk Film Festival</a>, which was held annually in Park City, Utah, alongside and as an alternative to the buzzier Sundance Film Festival. Screenings and events later expanded to film festivals in Toronto and Cannes.</p><p>Slamdunk aimed to draw attention to independent filmmakers who couldn't get a spot at Sundance, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>festival co-founder</a> <strong>John Peterson</strong> explained to MovieMaker. The festival operated for five years, holding its last events in 2003.</p><p><strong>For more celebrity updates sent right to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Justin-Henry-in-2014.jpg><p>Though Henry still acts and appears onscreen occasionally, most recently participating in the On Cinema comedy series as well as <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>in short films</a>, he has spent most of the last several decades building a career outside of the spotlight. Henry works in marketing and digital media for tech companies and agencies in the Los Angeles area.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Former Child Actor "Was in Danger" on Movie Set, Co-Star Admits</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/Justin-Henry-in-2019.jpg><p>Though Henry told the On Screen & Beyond podcast that he hasn't remained in touch with his one-time fictional parents Hoffman and Streep, saying only that he occasionally runs into Hoffman in L.A. But he thinks back fondly on his experiences making the film and remembers them as "nurturing, caring, and kind." He particularly recalls enjoying the time he spent running around New York with Hoffman, noting that their "relationship onscreen was a result of what we did offscreen."</p><p>To that end, he's continued to support the film over the decades, appearing at events celebrating its 30th anniversary in 2009 and 40th anniversary in 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmm6GcocZut9GapJ6qXavAbrfRmqSeql2jvLh5zZ6urGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./immediately-html.html><span>←</span><span>Immediately</span></a>
