At 7’1”, 275 pounds, he had been a track star before turning the game of basketball on end with his dominance. In the 1961-62 season alone, he averaged an unprecedented 50.4 points per game, during which he had 100-, 78-, 73- and 67-point games.</p><p>Were it not for Bill Russell, it may have been Chamberlain holding the most NBA championships. But, Russell, at only 6’9”, understood the idea of team play and redefined the role of the NBA big man. Russell won 11 titles, including eight consecutively. He was a rebounding machine and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">averaged</a>&nbsp;22.5 rebounds per game, once taking down 51 in a single game.</p><p>Without <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elgin Baylor</a>, there would be no Dr. J, no Dominique Wilkins and perhaps no Michael Jordan. The high-flying small forward had ridiculous hang time, averaged a double-double most of his career and, during the 1961-62 season, put up 38.3 PPG, second only to Wilt in NBA history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG5tZG6GcnnRmqWkoZ6ceqatwqFknZ2TlrGmec6fZKeakWKvor%2FKnqubmZyheqe%2BzqZkraCVYn56go%2BsZK2nXam8pa3Y</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./geli-raubal.html><span>←</span><span>Adolf Hitler's Niece And His Romantic Obsession</span></a>
