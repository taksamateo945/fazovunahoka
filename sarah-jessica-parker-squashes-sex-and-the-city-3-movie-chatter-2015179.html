<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Sarah Jessica Parker Squashes Sex and the City 3 Movie Chatter</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Every cloud has a silver lining, and every Louboutin has a red sole. <strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong> sat down with <strong>Matt Lauer </strong>on the Today show on Thursday, Sept. 17, as the bearer of bad news, telling the morning show host that the Sex and the City gals won’t be making another appearance on the big screen anytime soon.</p><p>“There is no decision,” the 50-year-old actress <a href=#>said of rumors</a> that there might be a third film installation to the beloved series. “It remains a not-often-had conversation. I know — and [writer-director] Michael Patrick [King] knows well — the story we might tell, if we ever tell it. But the real truth, and I’m not being cagey, is we’ve never discussed a when.”</p><p>Parker, who played iconic New York sex and relationship columnist Carrie Bradshaw on the hit late-‘90s HBO series, stirred up speculation of a Sex and the City 3 movie earlier this year when she posted a <a href=#>photo to Instagram</a> of herself in a flattering white dress and gold heels.</p><p>“Well. I guess the cat’s out of the (little brown) bag,” she captioned the shot, in which she strides out of Bloomingdales with the company’s trademark shopping bag. “As usual, we will keep you posted on every detail as we are able. I’m under a strict gag order until then.”</p><p>Fans quickly took the post as a hint that a third film was in the works, which Parker downplayed as a miscommunication.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Everybody reads and projects so much into what I say,” the actress told Lauer. “There is a story. When and if we tell it remains unclear.”</p><p>In the meantime, however, fans of SATC needn’t panic. Amazon Prime announced on Wednesday, Sept. 16, that it will start streaming all six seasons of the show. The series, which ran from 1998 to 2004, was previously only available through HBO Go.</p><p>“Sex and the City became one of the most popular shows on TV over its six season run, and we are excited today to give our Prime members access to every episode to watch anytime, anywhere as part of their membership,” Michael Paull, vice president of digital video, said in a press release.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqaqpGdequx0qygnJldpa6zt8SrZKyppZbAqbHSZqqesF2Wu6V506GcZpuZqcZuf4ympq%2BhlWKwqa3TrZyrZWJlfnZ9lnI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lsu-basketball.html><span>←</span><span>LSU Basketball Schedule | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</span></a>
