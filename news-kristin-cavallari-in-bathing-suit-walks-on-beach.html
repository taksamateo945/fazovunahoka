Read on to see 7 ways Kristin Cavallari stays in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Kristin-Cavallari-1.png><p><span>Kristin maintains that consistency is key when it comes to staying in shape. "It's important to give ourselves grace and not beat ourselves up," she explained to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Us</span></a><span>. "For so many years in my early 20s, I was all or nothing. I have the best relationship I've ever had with food and health because I've let go of a lot of that control. It's about consistency — just keep showing up."</span></p><p><span>Unlike most stars, Kristin trains herself. "I lift weights, but I do circuit training to keep my heart rate up. I also started doing hot yoga every once in a while. I don't do it as often as I would like, but I love it when I'm able to make it happen," she told Us.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1287140354.jpg><p><span>"I eat with my kids every night at 5:15 p.m.," she told Us. "I find that I sleep better when I eat early like that. And I eat enough so that I'm not hungry before I go to bed."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1210716945.jpg><p><span>Kristin eats food "as close to its natural state" as much as she can. "The way I eat is a lifestyle. Organic as often as possible, tons of veggies, meat, nuts and seeds, complex carbs like buckwheat soba noodles, berries, tons of fat — I even eat butter," she told Us. "We don't do anything white, so we don't do white flour, white sugar, or white salt," she added to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Women's Health</span></a><span>. "We definitely are a meat family. I've never been vegan or vegetarian; I don't think I could be. We actually have a freezer full of meat with all kinds of wild game."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kristin cooks her own food as much as possible. "I make dinner 90 percent of the time. I think that's important because that's the only way to truly know what's in your food," she told Us. However, she does indulge when she eats out. "When I go out to eat or go on vacation, I eat whatever I want and then I really enjoy it."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>"I like having some muscle definition without being bulky or looking 'jacked,'" she explained to Us. "Seeing results makes me want to push harder and gets me excited in the gym. I can honestly say my butt has gotten a lot bigger from being consistent in the gym, working on it for the past year. These results don't happen overnight. It's important to be patient and stay the course."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/GettyImages-1205226008.jpg><p><span>"I don't do any cardio," Kristin revealed to</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> Well + Good</span></a><span>. "Cardio used to be all I did before I had kids, but once I had them my lifestyle changed—I'm a much healthier eater and I hardly drink alcohol, so I've found that it's about building and maintaining muscle rather than losing weight now."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpKqZqMGquoycmK%2BZnKGus7WMoqVmmpGptaq6xmaqrqGkYsSiuMqsZKimXZeyoq%2FHaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kourtney-kardashian-says-she-likes-her-stretch-marks-377546.html><span>←</span><span>Kourtney Kardashian Says She Likes Her Stretch Marks</span></a>
