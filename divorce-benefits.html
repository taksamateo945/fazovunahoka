However, no matter how good your intentions are when entering a marriage, for many people, "I do" doesn't necessarily mean forever. According to research conducted by Penn State professor <strong>Dr. Paul Amato</strong>, the divorce rate still hovers between 43 and 46 percent for married adults, making for a veritable minefield of broken hearts out there.</p><p>The good news? (Yes, there's good news.) Divorce can be awesome, especially as you get older. Divorce at 40 can give you a new lease on life while your best years are still ahead. Instead of feeling like you've failed at marriage, you'll come to realize that divorce is simply another step toward success—at life.</p><p><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high width=1024 height=682 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/shutterstock_585849398.jpg alt="happy over 40 woman dating divorce at 40" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>A <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>bad marriage</a> rarely makes people happy. Staying together with your spouse for the kids, for the financial benefits, or simply because you're scared to be alone will leave you with a life full of regrets in the long run. In fact, one study&nbsp;by <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Avvo</a> revealed that the majority of divorced women studied did not regret their decision to end their marriage and actually found themselves happier living the single life.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=682 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/shutterstock_324364430.jpg alt="be a much better father divorce at 40" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Angry, resentful parents are rarely the ones most capable of raising healthy, happy kids. A study conducted by researchers at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Auburn University</a> found that parental discord had a profound effect on children's wellbeing and that staying in a bad marriage led to worse outcomes for children than a divorce did. Considering that most people have kids in their 20s and 30s, your children are also likely better-equipped to handle this kind of change by the time you're in your 40s than they would have been years prior.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=683 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/shutterstock_424584364.jpg alt="biggest New Years resolution mistakes divorce at 40" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Your 20s and 30s are often spent figuring out your interests and finding a job that works for you. However, with more than a decade of work under your belt, your 40s are a great time to focus on professional achievement. Fortunately, without a bad marriage occupying your time and mental energy, it will be easier than ever to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>reach your work goals</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/shutterstock_585849398.jpg><p>Your husband didn't love the theater, so you've never seen a Broadway show. Your wife didn't want to dance, so you never learned the cha-cha. Without the baggage of a deteriorating marriage holding you back, you'll have plenty of time to do the things your partner didn't want to. And with the confidence that's often gained naturally in your 40s, you won't feel the least bit embarrassed about doing them alone.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=682 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/shutterstock_407792557.jpg alt="40 things only women over 40 know divorce at 40" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When you're married, your individual priorities often get pushed aside in favor of the We. "We feel strongly about this political issue," "We don't do that in this house," and so on. However, when you're flying solo, you have a brand-new opportunity to discover what you actually consider important without your partner's influence. Bring on the&nbsp;I.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/shutterstock_324364430.jpg><p>Making a big change, like deciding to divorce at 40, can often be the catalyst for smaller changes, too. If you've been feeling unmotivated about making a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>career change</a>, renovating your home, or just getting to the gym more, the opportunity for reinvention a divorce offers might just kick things into gear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/shutterstock_424584364.jpg><p>It may be clear to you that your spouse was completely at fault for everything in your relationship. However, actually spending some time alone post-divorce provides you plenty of time to reflect on your own contributions to your relationship's demise. In the end, this will make it easier to <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/bad-habits/>change your bad habits</span> going forward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/11/shutterstock_531170065.jpg><p>According to one study published in <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Women in the World</a>, women don't even begin to hit their sexual stride until after their 36th birthday. If you find yourself <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>single in your 40s</a>, you've got a lot of fun sex on the horizon.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=683 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/media/images/ext/141053524/shutterstock_244615081.jpg alt="slang terms 50s divorce at 40" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When you don't have a spouse to prop you up, you'll have to figure out how to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>muster confidence all on your own</a>. Fortunately, many men and women find themselves more confident in their bodies, in the bedroom, and in their careers in their 40s than they did earlier in life. This newfound confidence makes it a whole lot easier to feel good about your post-divorce life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/shutterstock_407792557.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Traveling alone</a> allows you to experience new places and new cultures in a way you never would with a partner.

However, when that needy spouse is a thing of the past, you'll finally be able to focus on being the kind of parent you want to be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/tying-shoes-running.jpg><p>Committing yourself to one person for the rest of your life sets unrealistic expectations about how one person can emotionally fulfill another. The good news? Getting divorced in your 40s, when you're old enough to realize what you want and need from a relationship, can help you realize that your emotional (and physical) needs don't have to be met by a single person.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/man-thinking.jpg><p>Being married often means that the amount of alone time you enjoy is virtually nil. However, with divorce at 40, you might just find yourself with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>plenty of time alone</a>—and that's a good thing. Researchers at the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>University of Buffalo</a> have found that spending time alone is linked to increased creativity, giving you plenty of projects to look forward to when you're flying solo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/shutterstock_127898816.jpg><p>A bad partner can be the mortal enemy of ambition. Whether your spouse wants you to stay home to raise the kids or just be home every day by 5, those pressures can often make it seem like your ambition isn't worthwhile. Fortunately, with that bad marriage gone, you can be as ambitious as you want without feeling you're stepping on your partner's toes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/media/images/ext/141053524/shutterstock_244615081.jpg><p>As we get older, our ability to shrug off other people's opinions increases, <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/40-things-to-do-after-40/>making our 40s prime time for reinvention</span>.

However, divorce at 40 means you can finally put your needs first. Better yet, you'll understand—and be able to properly communicate—those needs a whole lot better than you did during the self-discovery of your 20s and 30s.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=682 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/shutterstock_586080812-1.jpg alt="Procrastination, productivity divorce at 40" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>A bad marriage, and the negativity that comes along with it, can put a major damper on your day-to-day life. When the source of that negativity has flown the coop, you'll be able to appreciate all the positive things your life has to offer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/Baby-boy-on-beach-with-dad-david-straight-123965.jpg><p>For many people, marriage and the financial boost that comes along with it can mean you're living beyond your individual, personal means. When your spouse's income or inherited wealth are gone, however, you'll be forced to create a budget of your own. Luckily, in your 40s, you still have <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>plenty of time to save for retirement</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/shutterstock_133378736-e1508865099750.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Forcing yourself to not be lonely</a>, even when you're alone, is a seriously valuable skill in the long run. When you divorce at 40, you'll either have to figure out how to make new friends or learn ways to feel less lonely during those times you're on your own.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=660 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/shutterstock_374492218.jpg alt="Relationship, couple, fall, better husband, hug divorce at 40" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>There's no time like the present to break those bad relationship habits that have kept you down. Whether your partners are <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>habitual cheaters</a> or you just don't listen to each other, getting divorced in your 40s can put an end to those bad habits. Better yet, you'll have plenty of time to build new, healthy ones in their place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/05/shutterstock_552797224.jpg><p>Having a spouse often means that certain things are their sole responsibility, like cooking, cleaning, or paying bills. Getting divorced in your 40s means you're old enough to not be willing to trade in home-cooked meals for ramen every night, but are still young enough to quickly learn how to do all the things your spouse once did for you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/handshake-face-shape.jpg><p>Remember your friends? They're still out there, and they're just as awesome as you remembered. When you divorce at 40, you finally have time for them. Better yet, by the time you're in your 40s, those friends who weren't worth your while have fallen by the wayside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/Acoustic-Guitar.jpg><p>A bad relationship can put major stress on virtually every part of your life. Fortunately, getting divorced as you approach middle age can help you prolong your life, too. Research published in the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>BMJ</a> reveals that <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/depression-anxiety-anthony-bourdain-kate-spade/>psychological distress</span>, like that caused by an unhappy marriage, is positively correlated with everything from cancer to death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/06/shutterstock_553281814.jpg><p>Kids pick up on discord at home. Research even suggests that they tend to repeat the patterns they see in their own relationships later in life.

With a bad marriage behind you in your 40s, you have lots of time to explore the kind of relationship that will work for you, whether that means casual dating, <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/polyamorous/>polyamory</span>, or a committed relationship with someone new.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/shutterstock_586080812-1.jpg><p>Stress and stagnation are killers—literally. Marital stress is linked to an increased risk of death, but research conducted at the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>University of Arizona</a> suggests that divorce is associated with weight loss and better health.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=683 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/holiday-season-healthy-eating.jpg alt="holiday season healthy eating divorce at 40" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>After spending years with a date on your arm, the prospect of doing things alone can be scary. However, you might find you actually enjoy those leisure activities more without a spouse you've fallen out of love with. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research&nbsp;and discussed in the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Washington Post</a> revealed that even people who were nervous about doing things like having a drink or going to a museum alone actually enjoyed themselves just as much as those who went with someone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/07/shutterstock_534262246.jpg><p>Getting divorced in your 20s after a bad fight can be an impulse decision. Divorce at 40 rarely is. When you're in your 40s, you're certainly mature enough to make this decision, and are less likely to be hounded by the frequent "are you sure" queries from well-intentioned, but ultimately annoying, friends and family.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=683 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/media/images/ext/493921153/shutterstock_184844336.jpg alt="not appreciating one another is a mistake married people make divorce at 40" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>It sometimes takes a bad relationship to discover what constitutes a good one. Coming out of a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>bad marriage</a> in your 40s gives you the perspective you need to start a relationship with a partner who is all the things your ex wasn't, whether you want a good listener or someone with more financial stability.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/friends-dinner-party-conversationalist.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>CDC data</a> revealed that more people find themselves <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/the-surprising-way-reddit-can-help-you-fight-depression/>depressed</span> during middle age than at any other point in life, and an unhappy marriage is likely to make those symptoms even more pronounced. Fortunately, ending a bad relationship in your 40s can help you beat this common middle-aged slump and help you find happiness that your marriage lacked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/shutterstock_374492218.jpg><p>A good family can take any shape.
