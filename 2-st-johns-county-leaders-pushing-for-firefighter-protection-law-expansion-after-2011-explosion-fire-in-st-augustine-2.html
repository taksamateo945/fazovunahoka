He was forced to medically retire.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">That news prompted Stevens and St. Johns County Commissioner Sarah Arnold to fight for some significant changes.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">“Knowing that we have between 50 or 60 people that day, knowing that they are waiting every day for a sign of something to pop up is something that we have to act on,” Arnold said. “We have to do something about this.”</p><figure class="sc-dkzDqf dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-5 gQyjmp eeCpcl full-width" id=EXZKFM2LFZFKTFMU25KDN2H3VQ><span class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 kGduZK">Florida lawmakers</span><span class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gXaOYT"> (Copyright 2024 by WJXT News4Jax – All rights reserved.)</span></figure><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">Arnold and Stevens lobbied at the state capitol last week in an attempt to expand Florida’s presumptive disability for firefighters to include neurological diseases, like Parkinson’s.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">They met with state Senator Travis Hutson and Representative Cyndi Stevenson.</p><figure class="sc-dkzDqf dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-5 gQyjmp eeCpcl full-width" id=GOXN4AO5RZDCNADD3BUWBFVGBE><span class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 kGduZK">FL Lawmakers</span><span class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gXaOYT"> (Copyright 2024 by WJXT News4Jax – All rights reserved.)</span></figure><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">Arnold and Stevens were also joined by St. Johns County administrator Joy Andrews, deputy administrator Brad Bradley, and commissioner Christian Whitehurst.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">That change would give financial benefits to firefighters.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">“They end up with this disease,” Stevens said. They get medically retired, they are out of work, their benefits are cut because they did not finish their full career because of the disease. The medical bills stack up and they are not even able to afford paying their medical bills. Presumption law would help solve some of those problems and take care of the firefighter.”</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">“It is absolutely devastating,” Arnold said. “I am sure it is devastating to him and his family as well. Anything that we can do, any financial relief or tax benefit that we can get pushed through at the state level to not only help him and his family, but any of the other firefighters that have been affected by this. It is of paramount importance and our top priority.”</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">The expansion Stevens and Arnold are fighting for already exists in three other states: New York, Virginia, and Indiana.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">They want Florida to assemble a task force to study and research the connection between neurological disorders and firefighting. Stevens and Arnold hope lawmakers will discuss, establish, and pass a bill during the 2025 legislative session.</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">“Every day you pass a fire station,” Arnold said. “Every day we hear those sirens, and we know that that is a moment for prayer, a moment that they are going to save one of our neighbors. We have to fight for them. We have to continue to fight for them to protect them.”</p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB"><b>RELATED: </b><b>2 companies cited after gas station explosion</b></p><p class="sc-dkzDqf dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 gLFytU itaLjB">The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Coomes Oil and Supply Inc. doing business as the 5th Wheel BP gas station in St. Augustine, and Florida Rock and Tank Lines Inc. for safety hazards after an employee of the latter company was burned.
