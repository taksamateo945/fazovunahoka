This year, the Twitter account <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>@MixerManagement</strong></a> is the winner of our fan-voted Twitter Fandom Award for <strong>Best Little Mix Fan Account</strong>! The account was founded only two years ago but has racked up almost 10,000 loyal followers, one of them the official account for the popular UK girl group in question. True to their name, they are essentially a fan-run management for Little Mix. Many fans of the group feel unsatisfied with the promotion they receive from their actual management, so they decided to take matters into their own hands. As the quote in @MixerManagement’s Twitter bio says: “If Syco won’t do it, we will. #ChangeStartsWithUs”.</p><p>@MixerManagement is well known for posting updates on the group and encouraging Mixers to vote for Little Mix to win awards or request their songs. They also frequently interact with other Little Mix fans by running polls and asking their followers questions. This is how the account remains active even on days when the updates are sparse, in addition to retweeting relevant tweets from other fans and update accounts.</p><p>A fan since the group’s formation on the X-Factor, Nathan, a co-owner of @MixerManagement, is a ride or die Mixer who posts several times a day on the account. CelebMix got a chance to chat to Nathan about their love for Little Mix and what running an update account is really like. Read the full interview below:</p><h4>When did you start @MixerManagement and what compelled you to make an update account?</h4><p>It was actually Annabel who created MMHQ back in Feb 2016. She was looking for co-owners to help her out so I was the first co-owner of the account. I wanted to join as I love updating fans about Little Mix and sharing that bond as I had another LM update account at the time.</p><h4>How has owning an update account impacted your life?</h4><p>It has affected my life but in a good way. I like to be on top with any updates or other news. So I am always trying my best to keep fans updated.</p><h4>What does being an update account mean to you?</h4><p>I love being a part of @Mixermanagement as I love interacting with more Little Mix fans. I love that people come to our account from across the world for information and updates about Little Mix.</p><h4>What do you enjoy most about @MixerManagement?</h4><p>Well everything really, I love reading other Mixer’s opinions about things also generally being able to help with requesting, fan voting, streaming, winning the girls awards etc.</p><h4>Give us a quick break down on the daily life of being an update account? Do you have a day to day routine on where to get updates first or do you just update on whatever you see first?</h4><p>I do try to at least tweet about 3 times a day. I always look around on websites and Twitter first to find updates about Little Mix. Then share it with other Mixers on my account.</p><h4>What do you love most about Little Mix?</h4><p>I really love Little Mix’s friendship. It is so tight for four girls who didn’t even know each other just put in a girl group in 2011 at x factor then 7 years on there the 9th biggest girl group ever with over 43 Million Records Sold WW! You can really tell their friendship is strong as the way they act on stage and on their days off. Also, their vocals are insane!</p><h4>When did you become a fan? How did you hear about them?</h4><p>I became a fan way back in 2011 when they got put together in a girl group. I knew from that day at judges houses than these four girls are going to be huge in coming years and of course, I was right!</p><h4>Do you like collaborating with other accounts or have you ever collaborated with other accounts? Would you consider it if you haven’t?</h4><p>We always talk to other update accounts as we have got a group DM. We are always planning huge projects that with help the girls.</p><h4>Was there ever a point down the road where you wanted to delete @MixerManagement?</h4><p>&nbsp;No, I have always liked being able to update fans and interact with them.</p><h4>What was your first reaction when you found out you had been nominated for a CelebMix Twitter Fandom Award, and what was your reaction when you found out you won?</h4><p>I was shocked that people from around the world actually voted for us to win this award. I was really grateful to see that people do really enjoy our account.</p><h4>Where do you see @MixerManagement in the upcoming years? Do you think you’ll still be updating through your account?</h4><p>Hopefully, we can grow even more and welcome more Mixers to our account. Of course, I will be still updating as I love being part of this fandom!</p><h4>This is your official acceptance speech for the 2018 CelebMix Twitter Fandom Awards: do you have anything to say to the people who nominated and voted for you, to your loyal supporters, or Little Mix?</h4><p>I just wanted to say I am so grateful to everyone who has supported us over the years and made our account this big. You guys are really lovely and we love updating you on the amazing Little Mix. We love you guys and thank you so much- here’s to the future of MMHQ and Little Mix!</p>We’d like to thank Nathan for answering our questions and congratulate @MixerManagement on their CelebMix Twitter Fandom Award!
