LOL.’</p><p>It did not take long for the comedian and NFL star to clap back.</p><p>Kevin jokingly wrote: ‘F**k off man…. I used the product this week.’</p><p>‘Man I can shave! And I look younger than u,’ Deion also responded.</p><p>But it sounds like the rapper is in the minority when it comes to his opinion on the men he slammed.</p><p>In reality, a lot of users could not help but gush over their salt and pepper styles, saying that they looked really good like that.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-ZoPxmnsln/</p><p>Diddy showed off his white hair in a video meant to encourage people to ‘step this superhero s**t’ when it comes to the coronavirus efforts, especially in helping healthcare workers who are risking their lives every day.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>While people were definitely appreciative of his message, there were also many comments praising his salt and pepper hair.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGdlZXqksc2tZKygkZmytHnKnq2ipl2drrPAjJqlnWWUnrGlxYyfpqtll5rBtbXNoGSopJRirqfAxKtkraCVrnq0tM6wZKielmLBqbHIq2SsmZypeqK6w2annqigmr9utMCiqWahnmK%2Btq3RmqWtoZ6aenSEk2xtcmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-munn.html><span>←</span><span>Olivia Munn Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
