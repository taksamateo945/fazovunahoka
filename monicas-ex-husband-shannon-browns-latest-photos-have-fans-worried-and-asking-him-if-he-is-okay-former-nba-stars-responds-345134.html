Some of the former NBA star’s fans were worried that he might take too long to sulk after the breakup, but that does not seem to be the case.</p><p>Quite the opposite, he has been waiting for this moment for quite a while, as recent photos have shown him shirtless with a new blond hairstyle. Is he looking for a new love, or is he just testing the waters with his looks?</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Nxj0Ujgo3/</p><p>It is hard to tell, but in any case, Shannon does not seem shy about showing off his new hairstyle or physical transformation.</p><p>His divorce from Monica was just last month, but it does not seem to have affected him too much, as he has been able to move on with his life somewhat well after the split.</p><p>However, some fans are worried that he is changing his looks drastically. One supporter told the former NBA star:<br>“Hope you are okay, Shannon.” He responded by saying he is okay.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B349NjChwUR/</p><p>Meanwhile, Monica herself seems to be doing quite well. She is not all too bothered about the situation, as she was reportedly spotted celebrating her birthday together with T.I., Tiny Harris, and many other celebrities.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Gxc0Hjhem/</p><p>All in all, it starts to seem like this divorce was something that both needed and was perhaps even looking forward to in their lives, judging by how quickly they have jumped at the opportunity to enjoy their newfound freedom.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B4u1yNQDEuW/</p><p>Monica did speak about the divorce and said this: “Even though I’m I’m on reality T.V., there there’s certain parts and elements of it that I’ve I’ve never discussed because when you get married, and it is between the two of you, and whatever happens within it, it’ sits God and us. No matter what happens, he will always get my absolute respect, gratitude, and also my assistance in being a part of whatever his life becomes … I’ll I’ll be there to support because that’s what I vowed to do, even when the other side of it does not work.”</p><p>Hopefully, neither of them decides that they are missing their ex, though, because that would undoubtedly make things messy in the current situation.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>However, there does not seem to be any chance of that happening anytime soon.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedpLuqr8CsZJ6wXZ3CtK7Ap5tmq5iWu6%2B7zWaZq6eno8BuuMCtnKysXaW1sMDOrGShmaaaeqetzaxksKeip7amsIyapZ1lkai4qrrGZp%2BipV2es260xGagrGWfoK66ecWoqaadomK7o62MrKuaqqNiv6a%2Fz6ilnatdaIF2fZJtZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-meets-godson-jaime-kings-baby-leo-adorable-photos-2015287.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Meets Godson, Jaime King's Baby Leo: Adorable Photos!</span></a>
