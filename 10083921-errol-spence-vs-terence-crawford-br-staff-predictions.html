Crawford, meanwhile, is a southpaw who shifts stances better than anyone in the game and is a master at managing range, which allows him to be effective while both leading and countering. So, with all that being even, the answer is in the intangibles.</p><p>And in this case, that means the question is "Who is the bigger dog?"</p><p>To me, with no other evidence than a pre-fight vibe, it's Crawford. His all-around skill is beyond question, but what's just as certain is the glee with which he delivers his brand of precision violence. When the fight is there to be taken down the stretch, it feels like he's the one who'll take it.</p><p><b>Prediction: </b>Crawford by TKO, Round 11</p><p><i>- Lyle Fitzsimmons</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGiGc32Mnqmrp5xiwLGxzZycZq6jYsGmvsSnmp5lk6euuLLOq5tmmqJiwLWtxZ9kqaqVmbakwMiopaw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gentle-rock-arrangements-nyt-crossword-clue-1113051.html><span>←</span><span>Gentle rock arrangements?
