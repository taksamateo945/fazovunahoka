We've been crying for electricity in this area for months. We've got emails. We've been fighting with them for about two years to electrify the area. The authorities are just not listening," said Van Rensburg.<p class=align-left>Van Rensburg added that the community has called<a href=#> Eskom</a> to come to the damaged transformers for the past three months. She also alleged that the community had been denied services by the City of Cape Town because of private land issues.</p><p class=align-left>In another story, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GrounUp</a></i> reported that a 32-year-old man, Zukile Komani, was electrocuted in flood water in Mfuleni after the Kuils River burst its banks due to heavy rains.</p><h2>South Africans mortified by the deaths of young kids</h2><p class=align-left>@TherealMel_1 said:</p>"Such a tragic story."<p class=align-left>@RichmanSekatane said:</p>"Electricians and safety officers of the municipalities must answer."<p class=align-left>@TboozeSA said:</p>"This happens way too often.

May the young souls rest in eternal peace."<p class=align-left>@PhetoleAbubakar said:</p>"Cut all illegal connections to curb illegal activities happening there."<p class=align-left>@LoRd_HIGHbury said:</p>"If it is because of illegal connections, then the killers are most likely in the crowd."<p class=align-left>@SoYouThink4 said:</p>"Very sad news, our children should not be dying like this. The same community puts up these illegal connections, they are there but remain silent."<h2>Illegal electricity connections kill 4 in Mpumalanga in separate incidents</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Briefly News</strong> previously reported that the deaths of four people in <a href=#>Mpumalanga</a> have spurred the <a href=#>police to issue a stern warning</a> about illegal electricity connections.</p><p class=align-left>The victims were all from the Tonga area and were electrocuted because <a href=#>people</a> in the community decided to steal electricity from the municipality.</p><p class=align-left>The most recent incident occurred on Monday, 13 February.
