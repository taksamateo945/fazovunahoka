Superman: Dawn of Justice (opposite fellow hunk <strong><a href=#>Henry Cavill</a></strong> as the Man of Steel). “He’s eight percent body fat,” Garner <a href=#>told<strong> Kelly Ripa</strong></a>. “He looks pretty good. It’s a little bit like, ‘Whoa! Who are you?’ It feels like I’m having an affair. But I don’t mind, I’m not complaining! It’s fine.”</p><p>In <a href=#>a separate interview</a>, Garner said her husband was in a “strict and disciplined place in life” while preparing for his role as Gotham’s caped crusader. “He worked out twice a day and ate only what was put in front of him by some very mean, mean person…” the actress told <strong><a href=#>Ryan Seacrest</a></strong>. “Everything was cut out… If I made dinner and it was a healthy dinner, he wouldn’t even look at it, in case something hadn’t been steamed.”</p><p>Still, she said her husband could definitely bench press her with his newly revamped bod. “I can’t keep up with him clearly,” she told Extra. “He could bench me, but we work out at the same time. I do my little mini workout.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaJmepl2Ws6e4xJyiZqSfpLi0eceoq2aapZuzbq7AraSapl2owaK%2BjKmgnKylp7K0eZFpaG1vYWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./423786-10-tips-for-running-your-football-office-pool.html><span>←</span><span>10 Tips For Running Your Football Office Pool | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumors</span></a>
