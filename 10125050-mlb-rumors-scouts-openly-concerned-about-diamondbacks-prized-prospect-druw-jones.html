In 179 at-bats this season, he's recorded four home runs, and 31 RBI with a .279 batting average, .396 on-base percentage, .425 slugging percentage and an .821 on-base plus slugging percentage.</p><p>He has had a bit of a rocky start to his career as he suffered a torn labrum in his left shoulder ahead of his first season, keeping him off the field the entire year. In 2023, Jones played just 10 games for the Rawhide before injuring his right quadriceps, forcing him to miss two months. The same season, he had a hamstring injury, which sidelined him for a month.</p><p>Now, Jones is looking to stay healthy while also improving his game—primarily his swing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmp9dnyMpqObZaKqurC%2B0maqnKelqcBuu8%2BepaWxXZi8r6%2FEq6WenF2Wr7DB02abopmdpLulrsCcoqxloKe2u7HDZqerp6OlsqTAjJ2prq9dn7yvsdI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./las-vegas-man-is-murdered-after-buying-stolen-truck-and-failing-to-repay-800-debt-on-it.html><span>←</span><span>Las Vegas man is murdered after 'buying stolen truck and failing to repay $800 debt on it''</span></a>
