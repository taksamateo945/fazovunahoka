His numbers have experienced a dip over the past three seasons, but he recorded over 100 total tackles in each of his first seven years.</p><p>He was a well-respected presence among the Rams linebackers, and he became a leader on the team.

New Orleans had the 31st-ranked defense in the league last season, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allowing</a> more than 410 yards per game. Only the New York Giants had a worse defense (420).&nbsp;</p><p>There was a lack of consistency at linebacker in New Orleans, as eight players appeared at the position in 2015 with little success. It has one solid piece at the position in 23-year-old Stephone Anthony, who led the team in total tackles (112) in his rookie season.&nbsp;</p><p>The Saints did&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">restructure</a>&nbsp;the deal of Dannell Ellerbe, who was plagued by injuries last season, for a return. But New Orleans released David Hawthorne and Ramon Humber, two linebackers who started a combined nine games in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>Laurinaitis could provide the Saints defense with a true linebacker who has had plenty of success in the league. He'd anchor the unit and help the development of Anthony, who showed in his rookie year that he's capable of having a successful NFL career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9qYGaFeXnJmqSeq12hrra%2ByKeYoqyZqHqtrdOeqq1lnprEtHnRrqSoqqNiwLGxwq6jmqyZpLtuu81mnaudlWKuqLHNrWSlmg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hailee-steinfeld-nicholas-hoult-more-young-hollywood-stars-take-over-the-venice-red-carpet.html><span>←</span><span>Hailee Steinfeld, Nicholas Hoult, &amp;amp; More Young Hollywood Stars Take Over the Venice Red Carpet!</span></a>
