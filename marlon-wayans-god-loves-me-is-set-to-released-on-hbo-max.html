<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Marlon Wayans: God Loves Me Is Set To Released On HBO Max</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Marlon Wayans</strong>: God Loves Me, HBO Max’s forthcoming comedic special, is scheduled to be published and will be accessible for viewing on Thursday, March 2, 2023, at 3 a.m. ET/ 12:01 PT. The show is Wayans’ third with HBO Max, following Marlon Wayans: You Know What It Is in 2021. Marlon Wayans: God Loves Me is produced by Troy Miller and penned and sung by Wayans. Rick Alvarez, Michael Rotenberg, Steve Harris, Miller, and Wayans executive produce the hour-long program.</p><p>The HBO Max Original Comedy special’s formal logline is as follows:</p><p>“Filmed at Atlanta’s Center Stage Theater, Wayans delivers an uproarious hour-long performance, releasing his spot-on mannerisms and daring physical humor to address one of pop culture’s most notorious recent events – “the smack” at the 94th Academy Awards® celebration.”</p><p>It continues:</p><p>“With his inimitable blunt and boisterous style, Wayans skillfully weaves anecdotes from his own life with stories about his long-time friends, from divulging his teenage crush on Jada Pinkett Smith, getting humbled by Chris Rock in an early stand-up set, and examining the impact of Will Smith’s long career. This special is a bold tour de force, an uproarious yet serious examination of friendship, family, errors, and forgiveness.”</p><h2>Trailer</h2><p>On February 18, 2023, the original teaser for Marlon Wayans: God Loves Me was published on YouTube. It begins with Wayans playing on the smack dispute involving Chris Rock and Will Smith at the 2022 Oscars.</p><p></p><p>He then describes his friendship with Rock, referring to him as his “cruel stepbrother” who continually pressed him for new comedic content. The comic then admits to having a fixation on Jada Pinkett Smith and recounts an amusing incident between them. Marlon Wayans yells at the conclusion of the video, “Heaven adores me!”</p><h2>Marlon Wayans: God Loves Me has the potential to be Wayans’ most intimate effort to date.</h2><p>In an Instagram video supporting Marlon Wayans: God Loves Me, the actor and comic remarked on the notorious smack, opening up that it “jolted something” in him.</p><p>Wayans stated:</p><p>“It shocked me to my heart and compelled me to rethink my own existence, both emotionally and professionally.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Marlon-Wayans-God-Loves-Me-2.jpg alt="Marlon Wayans God Loves Me" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Will, Chris, and Jada were his pals, and his “emotional relationship” with them provided him with “a distinct viewpoint on what occurred.”</p><p>The article concluded with the following note:</p><p>“However, this program isn’t about ‘The Smack,’ but about how that incident transformed me. This debate was necessary. My only goal is not to hurt anyone concerned. Its purpose is to make people chuckle. Recovery begins when you unload your wounds and find a way to chuckle at your suffering. This program is about how I discovered that God truly loves me.”</p><p>In a Warner Media news statement, Marlon Wayans revealed that he was “happy to be back in business with HBO Max. He stated:</p><p>“We’ve had a lot of success with my last two shows, so this will be fantastic. I know HBO Max and the refined crew of execs are infamous for being real comic tastemakers and snobs, so I am pleased that they thought this special was… exceptional.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Marlon-Wayans-God-Loves-Me-1.jpg alt="Marlon Wayans God Loves Me" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Marlon Wayans: God Loves Me, produced and published by HBO Max, is set to be released on March 2, 2023, and will be accessible for viewing in over 61 countries globally.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>HBO Max</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Marlon Wayans: God Loves Me</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqqcpLtuw8CymKerXZy8pXnLqK2eq12ism610maqnqxdqbxuvsSlnJqrlZl6sLqMoZmoZZ2WxXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mary-beth-lugo-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Mary Beth Lugo Net Worth | Bio, Family, Address, Career</span></a>
