The couple share three children together — Ethan born in 2001, Ella who joined the family in 2004, and Emerson who was welcomed in 2010.</p><p dir=ltr>Now that her own kids have gotten older, Herbst does her best to spend quality time with them in nature and away from social media. The actress told Soaps in Depth, “I love taking [my kids] out into the fresh air and away from the concrete, cars, and electronics, and hiking for hours upon hours with just us for company. The conversations we have and the things we explore, it’s priceless. There’s no distraction.” In fact, Herbst makes it a point to make sure her family time is real-life face time and no one is on their phone while hanging out together.</p><p dir=ltr>Being a mom is Herbst’s most important job — seconded of course by her acting career — and though her character Elizabeth Webber does her best, it’s clear which woman would win a mother-of-the-year award. The actress has been quoted saying, “I aim to be the strong mom who reminds herself every day that this is what we do — we raise these kids to go out on their own and be strong, independent people, good stewards of the Earth and kind human beings.”</p><p dir=ltr>Though her actual family life is drama-free, Elizabeth certainly has her hands full raising three rambunctious boys in the soapy world of Port Charles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tooJ%2Bseq6tzbJknKCZobGzsc1mm6ido2K0prrEq5ilZZikwLG105qjZquklr9uvsSbnJybkWK1pr7BrKtmoJGrsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10095067-mike-tyson-on-francis-ngannou-partnership-theyll-make-a-movie-out-of-this.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Tyson on Francis Ngannou Partnership: They'll 'Make a Movie out of This' | News, Scores, Highli</span></a>
