The Michigan State product would have fit the Grizzlies as a physical defender who isn't afraid to mix it up with opposing teams and dominate games in ways other than scoring the ball.</p><p>He is also accustomed to playing alongside a star guard in Curry and could have used some of those two-man-game skills in partnership with Ja Morant.</p><p>Yet he ultimately <a href=#>agreed</a> to a new four-year, $100 million deal with the Warriors, keeping him with the only NBA team he has ever known.</p><p>It's probably for the best for him considering Memphis is 18-31 and has dealt with several injuries, including a season-ending setback to Morant. The playoffs are a long shot at this point.</p><p>Golden State is also outside the playoff picture looking in at 21-24, although it is just a half-game back of the Utah Jazz for the play-in tournament. It has also won two in a row after defeating the Grizzlies in Friday's contest.</p><p>Green is back in the lineup after he was suspended twice earlier this season for putting Minnesota Timberwolves big man Rudy Gobert in a chokehold and then later hitting Phoenix Suns center Jusuf Nurkić.</p><p>Perhaps the stability and veteran leadership provided by having him back in the lineup will help the Warriors make a late run, which are things that would not have been available if he chose the Grizzlies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGyFdHyMsJirqpmkv7R5w6uYsqWfo7Fus9GenKdlk6S7p7XRpqpmoJVisLC60qKbnqqVmXqru8inoKefXZy%2FqsbZpaCeq12eu266wZpkn6qVmnqis8SnmrI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-carroll-philadelphia-arrest-is-he-and-cody-heron-same.html><span>←</span><span>John Carroll Philadelphia Arrest: Is He And Cody Heron Same Person?</span></a>
