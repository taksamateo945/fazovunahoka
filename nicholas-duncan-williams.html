Months later, Mother Florence discovered that Baby Nicholas survived the medical procedure. It was then discovered that she was actually carrying twins—with baby Nicholas being the only survivor. His father, E.K. Duncan-Williams, an Ambassador, politician, and chief became actively involved in Nicholas’ life at the age of 16. With 43 sisters and brothers, Nicholas primarily raised himself learning the art of survival through difficult circumstances at a very young age. While growing up, on multiple occasions, he nearly lost his life. In 1976, on the bed of affliction—after tragically losing three of his fingers, Nicholas Duncan-Williams, was converted by nurses, Mrs. Raj (Hemalatha John Rajaratnam) of Nurses Training College, and the Acquah sisters, who evangelized to him on his hospital bed at now Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra. From that moment he gave his life to Christ and made a vow that he would spread the gospel throughout the nations and serve God for the rest of his life.</p><p>Nicholas Duncan-Williams (born 12 May 1957) is a Ghanaian Charismatic Pioneer, the Presiding Archbishop and General Overseer of the Action Chapel International (ACI) ministry, headquartered in Accra, Ghana.
