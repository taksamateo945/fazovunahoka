As fans of the hip-hop artist know, Tekashi 6ix9ine bowed out of the limelight after he got out of prison and released a number of hit tracks.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Tekashi released Tattle Tales</a> at the height of his so-called trollery, but it didn’t perform as well on the charts as he or his team had hoped, even though it still did quite well. Initially, Tekashi 6ix9ine and his team hoped it would get 150,000 units in one week, but it wound up shipping only 50,000 approximately.</p><p>Tekashi was beaten badly by Big Sean and his record, Detroit 2, which featured hit tracks like “Deep Reverence” featuring Nipsey Hussle who was shot and killed outside of his LA Marathon clothing store in March of 2018.</p><p>6ix9ine has fought with a number of prolific rappers since he got out of jail, including <a href=# rel=noopener>Snoop Dogg,</a> Meek Mill, and Lil’ Durk, but it was the feud with Meek that nearly intensified to the point of real violence this weekend.</p><p>Reportedly, Meek Mill and Tekashi 6ix9ine actually wound up at the same club this weekend and it was filmed and put online in a clip that has now gone viral in the hip-hop world.
