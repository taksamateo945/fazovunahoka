<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>How to Say Hi or Hello in Afrikaans, Xhosa, Shona and other Major Languages</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Saying Hello or Hi is one of the ways to show that someone is friendly and that the person recognizes the existence of the person he is greeting. In South Africa, saying Hello to someone, including a total stranger, is a sign of courtesy and an act that shows one is well-trained and mannered.</p><p>There are 11 major languages in South Africa including, and people that own these languages have their ways of saying Hello or Hi. Like the way people say Hello in different ways (depending on the part of the country you find yourself in), there are different responses to Hello in these major languages.</p><h2><strong>Saying Hello Is A Sign Of Courtesy</strong></h2><p>Saying Hello as a form of greeting does not in any way bring someone down or bottle your social status; instead, it shows how civil you are. It is necessary to acknowledge people irrespective of their age through various forms of greeting – whether through a friendly wave, a nod, a smile, or a hello. It is not a big deal if you say Hello to a younger person; in African culture, the younger ones are expected to greet elderly people first as a sign of respect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/hello3-e1638397224226.jpg><p>The South African culture promotes respect among its citizens. Whether you find yourself in an informal or formal environment, you should at least say Hello to anyone you may wish to speak with. When you enter a cab and meet someone, say Hello. When you want to ask for direction or make an inquiry from someone, say Hello or any form of greeting to the person.</p><p>Saying Hello to people of younger age, opposite gender, and lower class doesn’t make you less of who you are. While it is not compulsory to exchange pleasantries with people, it is necessary you do so at all times. And mind you, not everyone will respond to your greeting. That shouldn’t make you feel sad or disappointed. Just keep doing it.</p><h3><strong>How To Say Hello In IsiZulu</strong></h3><p>There are over 12 million native speakers of IsiZulu.
