On September 12, TMZ obtained certain court papers with the judge’s signature. The former couple reached an agreement via arbitration, and the rapper agreed to pay $4,305 in child support each month. Mena filed for divorce in May of last year, with the couple living apart but sharing joint custody of their children. The former couple, who got engaged on Christmas Eve 2018, married in October 2019 and had their first child in February 2020.</p><p>During her second pregnancy in 2021, however, Mena confessed that her spouse was cheating on her and supposedly tossed away all of his possessions. Mena and Safaree’s kid was born in June 2021, a month after she filed for divorce.</p><h2>Safaree’s work in the music business garnered him a lot of money.</h2><p>Safaree Samuels, who was born in New York City to immigrant Jamaican parents, rose to prominence in 2016 after appearing on the VH1 reality program Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood. The rapper, who has two sisters named Shaneequa and Samantha Samuels, returned to New York City in 2017 to appear on Love & Hip Hop: New York.&nbsp;CelebrityNetWorth estimates the 41-year-net old’s worth to be about $3 million.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Safaree.jpg alt=Safaree width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He’s made a lot of money through his work as a rapper, composer, actor, and reality TV star. In July 2020, Samuels and his ex-wife paid $848,000 for a home in Fayetteville, Georgia. The home was placed for sale in June 2022 and sold for $1.3 million.</p><p>Samuels’ primary source of income has been his music business professionals. He first joined Hood stars, which was founded in 2000 by Nicki Minaj, Lou$tar, and Seven Up. In 2004, the group created a song called Don’t Mess With, which was included on the album ThemeAddict: WWE The Music, Vol. 6. Hood stars&nbsp;eventually split up, and Samuels started working as a hype man for Minaj. In 2012, he appeared in Nicki Minaj’s music video for Stupid H*e. The rapper even contributed to Minaj’s second album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, by writing a few songs and appearing on the song Press Conference.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Safaree-1.jpg alt=Safaree width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 2015, Safaree released two mixtapes: It Is What It Is and It Is What It Is, Vol. 2.
