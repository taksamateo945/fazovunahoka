Hot New Hip Hop says Milan shared a post on her account this week in which she appeared to toss shade <a href=# title="Sources From Cosmo Nightclub Say Meek Mill Was Denied At Their Venue Not Because Of Race But Because Of History">Meek Mill</a>‘s way.</p><p>The outlet says even though Milan Harris just had a baby with the rapper, she appears to be more concerned with getting herself back into shape. On her account, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harris</a> wrote that she wasn’t going to worry about her breakup.</p><p>She wrote in her caption, “do squats and make’em wish he still had that a**.” Regarding her post-baby weight loss, Harris says she woke up in the morning and weighed herself at 178.4 pounds. Thus far, she has managed to lose 20 pounds.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CDSuc8fF216/</p><p>Fans of the rapper know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meek Mill</a> has been busy on social media as well, however, he hasn’t commented on his most recent dilemma. Meek Mill was just one of the performing artists who became a vocal critic of Tekashi 6ix9ine after he was released from prison to home confinement.</p><p>The rapper, like many others, accused 6ix9ine of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being a snitch without integrity</a> – a scorn on the rest of the hip-hop and black community. His hatred directed toward Tekashi 6ix9ine didn’t come without consequences, however.</p><p>Tekashi 6ix9ine and DJ Akademiks have been taking to Instagram live together to trash Meek Mill, accusing him of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being a hypocrite among other transgressions.</a> This was a point that even 50 Cent, the notorious Instagram troll, alluded to during his appearence on Lil Wayne’s podcast.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent</a> asked how Meek Mill could possibly be about prison reform when he has associated with people who have worked inside the prison system. Fans of Meek Mill know he has been fighting for criminal justice reform ever since he was released from the penitentiary.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Regardless of whatever moral inconsistencies, Meek Mill has had a rough past few years. He served time in prison, became an advocate for criminal justice reform, had a baby, broke up with his girlfriend, and came under fire by his contemporaries in the hip-hop scene.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGednrmiuoyhmKuqmah6orjLnp6enJyuerS0wJ2crGWdmrKsecyio6Vln6N6qbHRZqCgZZakua271qKloGWSp7Kit9SpZKedp6h6dX6Sa25uZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./veronica-gutierrez-devin-booker-mother-husband-children-wikipedia.html><span>←</span><span>Veronica Gutierrez Age, Wikipedia, Husband, Devin Booke Mother, Net Worth</span></a>
