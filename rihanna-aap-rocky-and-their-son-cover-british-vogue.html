You walk into the hospital as a couple and leave as a family of three. It’s nuts. And oh, my gosh, those first days are insane. You don’t sleep. At all. Not even if you wanted to. We came home, cold turkey, had no one. It was just us as parents and our baby. Man, you’re a zombie for the most part.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2023/02/rihanna4.jpg alt width=640 height=960 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>On how motherhood inspired her to perform at the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a></strong></p><p>&nbsp;“It’s this knowing that you can do anything,” she explains, “even things that seem the craziest, like, ‘I’m going to say yes to the Super Bowl in the middle of postpartum?’” She still can’t believe she agreed. “What the heck am I thinking? But you’re geeked on a challenge like that because you know what your body just did. You feel this sense of ‘Nothing is impossible.’” Not that the nerves aren’t jangling; of course, she had no clue when she accepted that she would be pregnant again by the time of the performance. “It was almost like an out-of-body experience,” she says of the day it was announced. “I have not been on stage in seven years,” she says. “Seven years! From zero to Super Bowl? That’s mental.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2023/02/rihanna5-1.jpg alt width=640 height=620 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>On her relationship with A$AP:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;“We’re best friends with a baby,” she says, laughing at their dynamic now. “We have to be on the same page, but we’ve always kind of had that in our relationship. Everything changes when you have a baby but I wouldn’t say it’s done anything but made us closer.”</p><p>On Rocky’s connection with their son:</p><p>“I’m just sitting on the sidelines when they’re together,” Rihanna says. “I’m literally the girl trying to get into the boys club, waiting for my turn. He is obsessed with his father. And I’m like: ‘Didn’t I give birth to you? What is going on?’” She laughs. “Their connection is undeniable. The second Rocky makes eye contact with him he is on fire. The whole thing they say about sons and moms, it’s a myth. Sons and fathers is crazy. I realized that the validation that you really need as a boy is from your father.”</p><p>Read Full interview at <a href=#>Vogue.co.UK</a></p><p>Photos: british Vogue</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWxmaWpfZoJwvsihmKemkWKuoryMq6aco6lirq%2BwjK2fnqGiYsCwuoycpq%2BdomKvs7XToqqhZaaktLaxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10107830-warriors-draymond-green-confirms-he-considered-joining-grizzlies-in-nba-free-agency.html><span>←</span><span>Warriors' Draymond Green Confirms He Considered Joining Grizzlies in NBA Free Agency | News, Scores,</span></a>
