I am having a hard time in really wanting to watch it. Just because I respect the fact, like, when artists say, ‘This is a documentary. It is OK to watch it.’ You know what I mean? I respect their space and privacy and point of view and story. What they feel like their own story is from their own brains, their hearts, mouths from which they speak. So I kind of respect that. But everyone says they really enjoy it and it is great.’</p><p>Another guest on the show, Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, Garcelle Beauvais, could confirm since she has watched it!</p><p>Beauvais dished that she was truly moved by the film, saying that Britney was ‘such a young girl living in a fishbowl. I felt sorry for her.’</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the documentary focused a lot on how Britney was treated by the media during her early career.</p><p>Furthermore, it also discussed the conservatorship Britney was placed under back in 2008.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>As you may know, her father, Jamie Spears, is still in charge of her estate and finances today and the pop star has been trying to remove him without any success.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebmrmtxYyrprCkkaOxbr%2FAsqpmq5iawG60wK%2Bgp59dlnqprdGdZK2hnZp6uK3NraCnn12pvG7DwK2aoWWknbJurtGiq6edqWLAsbHAq6pmnJ%2BYwq6xza2Yq7FdnbKzsdJmrqGxXWmEeoOXbmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sound-effect-from-a-microphone-sometimes-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sound effect from a microphone sometimes</span></a>
