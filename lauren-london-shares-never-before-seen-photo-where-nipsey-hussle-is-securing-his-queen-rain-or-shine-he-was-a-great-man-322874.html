Notice the God holding the umbrella and securing his Queen. 💪💪💪RIH Nipsey.🙏”</p><p>Another commenter claimed: “He was a great man, father, husband, friend, brother, example. He was an extraordinary human being who loved his family and community. He was an asset to his culture and neighborhood. He was loyal and real. He was a great artist, and he was definitely PROLIFIC💙🏁. But he was not God.”</p><p>This follower revealed: “We love you, Queen. I can’t even tell you to stay strong, because your heart is ripped to shreds. Through all of the darkness and sadness, the ancestors shall guide you to happiness again. Your children LOVE YOU, and WE LOVE YOU! Feel thus energy for the time being. It will only make you stronger, Queen. Ermias is with you every day, don’t doubt it.
