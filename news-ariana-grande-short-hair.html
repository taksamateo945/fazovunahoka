In a video posted to her Instagram, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Grande showed off short hair</a> that hits just above her shoulders and flips out at the bottom. She accompanied the new look with a fuzzy red-orange bucket hat. It's unclear how long she'll keep this style, but for now, take a look at Grande's short hair and the other rare instances in which she's shown off a different look.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/jared-leto-new-wework-show-news/ data-target=_blank data-rel=noopener>Jared Leto Looks Totally Unrecognizable for His New TV Show</span>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Ariana-2016.jpg><p>In an Oct. 2020 interview on the Zach Sang Show (via Yahoo!), <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Grande explained that she sees her ponytail</a> as part of her persona as a performer, and if she were to wear her hair natural while performing, she would have "hard time marrying it to the music."</p><p>"The <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>hair for me</a> is such a guard, character-façade type thing, and it's had its own evolution, but it has always been this kind of costume piece," she said. Of her natural hair, she explained, "I think that's kind of what I envisioned [the song '<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>My Hair</a>'] being about, is because it's such an intimate thing to be just like, 'curly shower head.' My boyfriend [now-husband <strong>Dalton Gomez</strong>] loves it. He's like, 'Curlies, yay!'"</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>This Is the "It" Hairstyle the Year You Were Born</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/ariana-short-hair.jpeg><p>W magazine reports that <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Grande revealed her shorter 'do</a> in a Instagram video that has since been deleted. But screenshots of the video captured online show Grande's new hairstyle. Along with the fuzzy bucket hat and bob, Grande did keep one of her signatures: her cat-eye makeup.</p><p>In 2019, Grande <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>posted a photo of herself</a> from when she was five years old on Twitter that showed her with short curly hair. She wrote, "If I'm honest ….. this is still exactly what I look like without lashes and my pony ….. anyone who knows me knows me knows."</p><p>A fan asked for pictures and Grande posted a video of herself (seen here)&nbsp;showing off her curly hair and added a dog filter.</p><p><strong>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/ariana-grande-met-gala.jpg><p>Grande <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>had a bleached blonde phase in 2018</a>. Here she is showing off the look at the 2018 Met Gala, though it appears she had some help from extensions to get an extra-long ponytail for her look.</p><p>In 2019, Grande told fans that dying her hair blonde was rough on her curls, but "<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>they're like halfway back</a>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/Ariana-2010.jpg><p>Grande rose to fame on the Nickelodeon series <i>Victorious </i>and its spinoff&nbsp;Sam & Cat. During this time, the singer had long bright red hair. In a Facebook post in 2014, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Grande said that the reason</a> the ponytail became her signature look in the first place had to do with her real hair being damaged after having it colored so much.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"I had to bleach my hair and dye it red every other week for the first four years of playing Cat… as one would assume, that completely destroyed my hair. I now wear a wig on Sam & Cat," she wrote, according to Yahoo! "My real hair is back to brown and I wear extensions but I wear it in a pony tail because my actual hair is so broken that it looks absolutely ratchet and absurd when I let it down."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>18 Actors Who Looked Unrecognizable in Major Movies</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmp52nqHqivsiapZpll6eur7DEZqqhp6KpeqmtyKtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./first-lady-2001-2009-with-the-secret-service-code-name-tempo-2-wds-html.html><span>←</span><span>First Lady (2001-2009) with the Secret Service code name Tempo: 2 wds.</span></a>
