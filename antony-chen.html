Despite the fact that he opened his antonychenn Tiktok account in late 2019, he only used it to view short videos. However, he came up with the concept of recording films on the app because he was bored during the pandemic.</p><p>Simultaneously, he became interested in anime and manga, and he desired to create content on these subjects. Making videos was a difficult option for him because he is an introvert. Regardless, he pushed himself out of his comfort zone and began posting things on his Tiktok site.</p><p>Despite the fact that he was in his sophomore year of college at the time, he went all in, uploading at least one video per day. For a few months, he continued to share more than 30 films per month. Finally, his perseverance paid off as his films went viral. He had a couple of videos that received up to 25 million views. By the end of the year, he had over two million followers.</p><p>Regardless, he has recently been inactive on the app as his attention has migrated to other platforms, namely YouTube and Twitch. According to statistics, his account currently has 2.6 million followers and 71 million total hearts. Check out this article on FaZe Sensei.</p><h2>Career on YouTube and Streaming</h2><p>Antony Chen made his YouTube debut on October 23, 2020, with the video “DAY IN THE LIFE OF A TikTok STAR.” After becoming bored with making everyday Tiktok videos, he decided to try making YouTube videos for a change, and this move proved beneficial. Not only that, but he is active on YouTube because he was unable to fully monetize his popularity on Tiktok owing to its intricacy. Unlike YouTube, producers rarely make videos from advertisements. Because of these factors, he prioritized his YouTube and Twitch feeds over his Tiktok account.</p><p>He was able to get all of his fans to subscribe to his YouTube channel by correctly promoting it on Tiktok. Before releasing lengthier format videos, he first published his Tiktok videos on the channel. He posts a wide range of content, including gaming and vlogging videos. On top of that, he recently launched the Ask Antony Q&A series. His upload schedule is also reasonable, as he posts about two videos per week. His channel currently has over 1.35 million subscribers and 214 million total video views. Besides this channel, he has two others: Antony CLIPS (Twitch stream highlights) and MoreAnt (Let’s Play videos).</p><p>He built his Twitch account to stream his favorite video games because he is an ardent gamer. He broadcasts a variety of video games, including Genshin Impact, Valorant, Crab Game, and many others. He began streaming regularly in December 2020 and has stayed steady ever since. Furthermore, he streams approximately 50 hours per month, with an average of 2k concurrent viewers. The channel currently has more than 495k followers.</p><h2>Antony Chen Girlfriend, Dating</h2><p><strong>Antony Chen</strong> has recently emerged as one of the internet’s emerging content creators. Everyone is curious about his relationship status as he becomes more popular. The answer to this inquiry is that he does not currently have a girlfriend. Furthermore, his marital status is unmarried.</p><p>As a result, we can conclude that he is more focused on his social media career and does not place a high value on things at the moment. In terms of previous relationships, he has dated at least one person in the last few years. Antony, on the other hand, has elected not to make this information public.</p><p>He is from an Asian family, but his exact origins are unknown. Chen is of mixed ancestry but of American nationality. He has, however, elected to keep his family details off the internet. As a result, we couldn’t find out anything about his father, mother, or siblings. Read about Joe Fazer, a fitness influencer.</p><h2>Antony Chen’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Antony Chen’s net worth is estimated to be $600,000 USD</strong>. YouTube, Twitch, and sponsorships are his main sources of income. According to Socialblade, his channel receives approximately ten million views per month. According to our calculations, he earns almost $22,000 each month in ad income. When it comes to his Twitch channel, he makes the most of the site by utilizing various features such as ads, cheers, contributions, and subscriptions. His revenues from advertisements, shouts, and donations are difficult to assess because they fluctuate so much.</p><p>Last but not least, he earns the greatest money through sponsorships. He uses his extensive social media following to collaborate with a variety of major companies all over the world. In recent months, he has collaborated with well-known brands such as G-Fuel, Amazon Prime Gaming, HoYoverse, and others. Unfortunately, we do not know how much he earns from a brand deal.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYp6yfo8Zur8eepWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./an-insight-into-the-life-of-renowned-musician-najim-mollou.html><span>←</span><span>An Insight Into The Life Of Renowned Musician Najim Mollou</span></a>
